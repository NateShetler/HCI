This program is made for Windows. It was made in Microsoft Visual Studio. You can compile via the command line. 
There are executable files in each of the sub directories of the parts of the project.

- In part1 the program will compute the square root of pi as many times as the user wants.
- In part2 the program will allow you to enter 's' in the middle of the calculation to 
stop the calculation. The rate of calculation is slowed down to give the user time to enter 's'.
- In part3, the program is split into multiple threads that are all executing at the same time. 
You may also enter 's' in the middle of the calcualtions if you wish to stop the calculation early.
The rate of calculation is slowed down to give the user time to enter 's'.
