PA1 is a simple calculation program that will calculate the square root of pi as many times
as the user wants. It will allow you to enter any integer or 'q' to quit the program.

- In part1 this is all the program does.
- In part2 the program will allow you to type 's' in the middle of the calculation to 
stop the calculation.
- In part3, the program is split into multiple threads that are all executing at the same time. 
You may also enter 's' in the middle of the calcualtions if you wish to stop the calculation early.

Instructions for how to run the program can be found for each part in their respective folders.
