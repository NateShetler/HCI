This program is made for linux. I used cmake to build the program.
To run the program you will need to:

1. Make a build directory
    - To do this you can type: mkdir build
2. Make sure to go into the build directory
    - To do this you can type: cd build
3. Next you will want to type: cmake ..
4. After that has completed you will need to type: make
    - This will generate the executable.
5. Now to run the program you can type: ./pa1_part1
